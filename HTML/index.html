            In this modern era of Information technology, Conferences are one of the most common tools used for interaction between researchers, academia, government agencies and industry. Conference provides a cohesive networking opportunity to the national/international researchers to share their work. Therefore, it is proposed to arrange an international conference annually by different institutions, under the umbrella of IEEE Lahore section. The conference will be technically sponsored by IEEE and the proceedings of the conference will be published in IEEE Xplore Digital library.
